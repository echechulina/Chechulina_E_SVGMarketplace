# Description
The project "Flower Logos" was created for companies, enterprises and individual entrepreneurs, leading activities related to flowers, art and the beauty industry. The bright sun, blooming gardens, spring warmth became my inspiration for the creation of the project. The main goal of "Flower Logos" is to demonstrate love, respect and enthusiasm for the beauty of nature.
